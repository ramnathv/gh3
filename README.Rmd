# gh3

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gh3 is to provide easy acccess to the [Github API V3](https://developer.github.com/v3/). The entire API is accessible via R functions that autocomplete.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gh3 from [github](http://github.com/ramnathv/gh3) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github('ramnathv/gh3')
```

## Example

You can get a list of all repos belonging to a user:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(gh3)
gh_users_get_repos('ramnathv')
```

## Implementation

The entire package including all functions and documentation are automatically generated from an unofficial [swagger specification](https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/github.com/v3/swagger.yaml) of the Github API. If you are curious, you can read the script generating the package:  [data_raw/generate_package.R](https://github.com/ramnathv/gh3/blob/master/data-raw/generate_package.R) 

## TODOs

- [ ] Revisit naming conventions for functions.
- [ ] Add `@family` and `@seealso` based on base path.
- [ ] Handle 3 cases where function name is duplicated.
- [ ] Set argument defaults based on swagger spec.
- [ ] Add documentation on additional parameters.
